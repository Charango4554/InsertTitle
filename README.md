# InsertTitle
I created a program that allows you to create a .txt file and add titles, this program is for a larger project.

This code is a simple Python program that allows the user to create a .txt file in the current directory or in a specified location. The user can also enter titles to be written to the file until they enter a specified stop word. The full file path is created using the "os" library in Python and combining the current working directory path with the file name entered by the user.
